                    3D SHOCKWAVE AT FOREVERME
                </h2>
                <p class="mt-lg-4 mt-2">Shockwave Works By Stimulating The Fat Break Down, Collagen Synthesis And Lymphatic Drainage. Shockwave Is Delivered By Placing A Probe Up Against The Areas Of Cellulite, As It Passes Over The Area It Emits Radial Waves Through The Skin.
                </p>
                <p>A Course Of Treatment Is Typically 8-10 Individual 45 Minute Sessions And Results Are Seen As Quickly As 2 Weeks After Starting The Course. If You Exercise And Increase How Much Water You Drink You May See Even Better Results. 90% Of Women Who Took Part In A Clinical Study Would Recommend This Treatment.

                <p>Shockwave Therapy Or Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT) Is An Innovative, Cost-Effective, Evidence-Based Treatment For Tendon Pain (Often Known As Tendinitis Or Tendinopathy) And Other Conditions Throughout The Body. Extracorporeal Means Outside Of The Body.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">The Main Benefits Of Shockwave Are Pain Relief And Restoration Of Function. Shockwave Therapy Has Been Shown To Be An Effective Treatment Modality For A Range Of Common Tendon Complaints Including Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendinopathy And Tennis Elbow.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">Shockwave Therapy Is A Safe, Non-Invasive Treatment With Convincing Evidence For Its Effectiveness From A Large Body Of Research And Clinical Trials. There Are Now Multiple, Randomised, Double-Blinded Clinical Trials That Support The Use Of Shockwave Therapy For Plantar Fasciitis, Lateral Epicondylitis, And Calcific Tendinitis Of The Shoulder.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-heading-two-line-2 mt-lg-5 mt-3">What Is Shockwave Therapy?</h2>
                <p>Shockwave Therapy Is An Effective Treatment Modality For A Variety Of Lower And Upper Limb Conditions. These Include:
                </p>
                <p>• Calcific Tendinopathy</p>
                <p>• Tennis Elbow (Common Extensor Tendinopathy)</p>
                <p>• Golfer’s Elbow (Common Flexor Tendinopathy)</p>
                <p>• Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (Also Referred To As Gluteus Medius Tendinopathy And/Or Trochanteric Bursitis)</p>
                <p>• Proximal Hamstring Tendinopathy (Also Referred To As High Hamstring Tendinopathy, Or Hamstring Origin Tendinopathy)</p>
                <p>• Patella Tendinopathy</p>
                <p>• Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy</p>
                <p>• Mid-Portion Achilles Tendinopathy</p>
                <p>• Plantar Fasciitis</p>
                <h2 class="main-heading-two-line-2 mt-lg-5 mt-3">How Does Shockwave Therapy Work?
                </h2>
                <p>This Is Sometimes Known As Its ‘Mechanism Of Action’. Shockwave Therapy Uses A Specialist Device To Deliver Acoustic Energy Through The Skin To The Injured Part Of The Body. The Shockwaves Are Mechanical And Not Electric. They Are Audible, Low-Energy Sound Waves, Which Increase The Blood Flow To The Injured Area.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Shockwave Therapy Has Two Main Modes Of Action Which Will Help With Persistent Tendon Pain. First The Shockwaves Work To Desensitise Nerve Endings Which Will Often Give An Immediate Reduction In Pain. Secondly, And Often Most Importantly, The Shockwaves Cause Controlled Micro-Trauma (Microscopic Damage) To The Tissues Which Encourages The Body To Respond By Increasing The Blood Circulation And Metabolism In The Affected Area. This Will Activate And Accelerate The Body’s Own Healing Response. The Shockwaves Can Also ‘Breakdown’ Disorganised Tissue And Calcifications.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-heading-two-line-2 mt-lg-5 mt-3">Is There Clinical Evidence Supporting The Use Of Shockwave Therapy?
                </h2>
                <p>There Is A Significant Body Of Evidence Supporting The Use Of Shockwave Therapy In Many Common Conditions. For More Information About Your Specific Condition Please Use The Links Above.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    The Use Of Shockwave Therapy For Tendon Issues Is Well Supported By The National Institute For Health And Care Excellence (NICE). NICE Provides National Guidance And Advice To Improve Health And Social Care In Both NHS And Private Practice. It Provides Evidence Based Recommendations To Guide Best Practice Within Healthcare. NICE Have Produced Guidelines For The Use Of Shockwave In The Treatment Of Achilles Tendinopathy, Plantarfascitis And Calcific Tendinopathy.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    In Summary, Shockwave Therapy Significantly Reduced The Pain That Accompanies Tendinopathies And Improves Functionality And Quality Of Life. It Has Been Stated That Shockwave Therapy Has A 70% Success Rate For Tendinopathies (Moya Et Al, 2018, Dedes Et Al 2018).
