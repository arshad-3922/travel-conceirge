                </h2>
                <p class="mt-lg-4 mt-2">Cryolipolysis Is Fast Becoming A Popular Treatment. In Basic Terms, This Treatment Involves The Freezing Of Fat Cells In A Specific Area Of The Body. Fat Cells Have A Weak Structure, And Therefore Cannot Survive At These Temperatures. They Die And Leave The Body Through The Lymphatic System, Which Works To Remove Toxins. As A Result Of This, Fat In The Target Area Is Reduced, Giving You A Healthier And Toned Appearance. Cryolipolysis Is Ideal For Areas Where Fat Is Hard To Get Rid Of Through Lifestyle, For Instance, The Chin, Stomach, And Back.

                </p>
                <p class="mt-lg-4 mt-2">It Is Important To Us That We Understand Your Goals. Therefore, Once You Have Undergone A Full Consultation, We Can Plan Your Treatment. Cryolipolysis Sessions Last Approximately 1 Hour, During Which Time A Cooling Gel Pad Is Placed Onto The Target Areas. When The Vacuum Applicator Draws In The Fat, You May Feel A Mild Cooling Sensation; This Is Perfectly Normal And All A Part Of The Fat Freezing Procedure.

                <p class="mt-lg-4 mt-2">Radio Frequency Delivers A Safe Electrical Current To The Treated Area Via The Electrodes On The 3D Lipo Machine. The RF Heats The Area And Deeply Penetrates The Skin. Our Brain Interprets The RF As A Source Of Energy, Causing The Skin To React Like A Resistor. By Heating The Cells Within A Safe Range, This Tightens The Skin, Making It Smoother And Reducing Cellulite.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">As We Get Older, The Integrity Of Our Elastin And Collagen Proteins Decrease, Causing Our Skin To Wrinkle And Become Loose, As Well Making It More Susceptible To Cellulite. It Is The Heat From The Radio Frequency Procedure That Stimulates The Collagen, Causing It To Contract And Tighten, While Disrupting Stubborn Fat Cells.
